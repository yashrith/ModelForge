AI Music Generator
This AI music generator leverages machine learning techniques to analyze and generate music based on specific musical features. The project involves:

Data Processing: Extracting musical features such as Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), chroma, and spectral contrast from a dataset of music tracks.

Model Training: Using machine learning algorithms, such as an SVM or deep learning models like LSTMs, to learn patterns in the dataset and predict or generate music in similar styles.

Feature Engineering: Performing dimensionality reduction and feature scaling to enhance the model's ability to generalize from the input data.

Music Generation: After training, the model generates new music sequences or predicts genres/styles based on input data.

The application is designed to explore AIâ€™s capabilities in the field of music, demonstrating how artificial intelligence can be used to either classify music genres or generate new compositions in specific styles.
