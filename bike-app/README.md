Project Description:
This project focuses on building a machine learning model that predicts the number of customers who will come to rent bikes based on various environmental and situational factors. Using a dataset that includes information such as the datetime, season, holiday, working day, weather conditions, temperature, feels-like temperature (atemp), humidity, windspeed, and historical rental data, the model aims to forecast customer demand for bike rentals.

An MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) regressor is employed to learn the relationships between these factors and the number of customers who come to rent bikes. The model is deployed in a Streamlit application, where users can input different environmental and situational conditions and visualize real-time predictions of how many customers are likely to arrive.

Key Features:
Input Parameters: Users can adjust environmental inputs like weather, temperature, humidity, and windspeed via an interactive interface.
Real-Time Prediction: The application predicts the number of customers who are expected to come for bike rentals in real time, showing the predicted demand based on user inputs.
Dynamic Visualization: A prediction curve shows the expected number of customers, updating dynamically as input parameters are modified.
Streamlit Interface: The model is integrated into a Streamlit web application for easy interaction and visualization of results.
Technologies Used:
Python: For data handling, model training, and deployment.
MLP Regressor (scikit-learn): To predict customer demand for bike rentals.
Streamlit: For building an interactive and user-friendly web app that allows real-time input and output.
Matplotlib/Plotly: For visualizing the prediction curve and analysis of bike rental demand.
Outcome:
This project provides a valuable tool for bike rental services, helping them predict customer demand under various conditions. The interactive Streamlit application allows users to simulate different scenarios and see how changes in environmental factors affect customer turnout for bike rentals.
